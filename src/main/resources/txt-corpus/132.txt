LICENSE RESTRICTIONS Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as otherwise authorized in writing by GTK, Customer has no right to (1) use, print, copy, display, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, or decompile the Licensed Software in whole or in part; (2) disclose, publish, release, sublicense, or transfer to another person any Licensed Software; (3) reproduce the Licensed Software for the use or benefit of anyone other than Customer; or (4) modify any Licensed Software. All rights to the Licensed Software not expressly granted to Customer hereunder are retained by GTK. All copyrights and other proprietary rights except as expressed elsewhere in the Licensed Software and legal title thereto shall remain in GTK. Customer may have installed Licensed Software at only one workstation at customer's site at any given time. Customer may not transmit the software electronically to any other workstation, computer, or terminal device whether via a local area network, telecommunications transmission, or other means without prior written permission by GTK. As an alternate to Section 1, you may install a copy of the Software on a network storage device, such as a server computer, and allow one access device, such as a personal computer, to access and use that licensed copy of the Software over a private network. You must obtain a license to the Software for each additional device that accesses and uses the Software installed on the network storage device. You may use remote access technologies, such as Remote Desktop, PC Anywhere, Terminal Server, to access and use the licensed copy of the Software, provided that only the primary user of the device hosting the remote session accesses and uses the Software with a remote access device. These remote access rights do not permit you to use the Software on both the device hosting the remote session and the access device at the same time. 2. TERM AND TERMINATION This Agreement shall be in effect from the date Customer accesses software until terminated by Customer, by PTI on behalf of Customer or GTK, or by GTK as set forth herein. This Agreement may be terminated by GTK without cause upon 30 days written notice, or immediately upon notice to Customer if Customer breaches this Agreement or fails to comply with any of its terms or conditions. 3. BACKUP AND REPLACEMENT COPIES Customer shall be permitted to make one back-up copy, provided GTK's copyright notice and Software License Agreement is included in the copy. 4. PROTECTION AND SECURITY OF LICENSED SOFTWARE (a) Customer will not provide or otherwise make available any Licensed Software in any form to any person other than employees of Customer with the need to know, without GTK's written permission. (b) All Licensed Software in Customer's possession including, without limitation, translations, compilations, back-up, and partial copies is the property of GTK. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, for any reason, Customer shall immediately destroy any Licensed Software, including all media and reference manuals, and destroy any Licensed Software that has been copied onto hard disks. Upon request, Customer shall certify its compliance in writing with the foregoing to GTK. (c) Customer shall take appropriate action, by instruction, agreement, or otherwise, with any persons permitted access to the Licensed Software, to enable Customer to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement with respect to use, copying, protection, and security of Licensed Software. (d) If GTK prevails in an action against Customer for breach of the provisions of this paragraph, Customer shall pay the reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and expenses incurred by GTK in connection with such action in addition to any final judgment of damages. 5. CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY The essential purpose of this Agreement is to provide Customer with use rights for Licensed Software. Customer accepts full responsibility for (1) selection of adequate and appropriate Licensed Software to satisfy Customer's business needs and achieve Customer's intended results; (2) use, set-up, or installation of the Licensed Software; (3) all results obtained from the Licensed Software; and (4) selection, use of, and results obtained from any other software, programming equipment, or services used with the Licensed Software. 6. LIMITED WARRANTIES GTK warranties that (a) GTK has title to the Licensed Software and or the right to grant Customer the rights granted hereunder; (b) the Licensed Software provided hereunder is GTK's most current version thereof; (c) the copies of the Licensed Software provided hereunder are accurate reproductions of the originals from which they were made; and (d) the Licensed Software does not infringe any current United States patents or copyrights or any other right of any third parties. 7. INFRINGEMENT GTK will defend Customer against a claim that Licensed Software furnished and used within the scope of the license granted hereunder infringes an existing U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret, or other property right, and GTK will pay resulting costs, damages, and attorney's fees finally awarded subject to the limitation of liability set forth in the paragraph entitled Limitation of Remedy, provided that: (a) Customer promptly notifies GTK in writing of the claim. (b) GTK has sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations. However, if the costs and damages attributable to a claim of infringement of a U.S. patent or copyright may exceed such limitation of liability, Customer may elect to defend against the claim provided that GTK may fully participate in the defense and or agrees to any settlement to such claim. (c) If such claim has occurred, or in GTK's opinion is likely to occur, Customer agrees to permit GTK at its option and expense either to procure for Customer the right to continue using the Licensed Software or to replace or modify the same so that they become non-infringing. If neither of the foregoing alternatives is reasonably available, Customer shall, on one month's written notice from GTK, return the original and all copies of the Licensed Software. (d) GTK shall have no obligation to defend Customer or to pay costs, damages, or attorney's fees for any claim based upon (1) use of other than a current unaltered release of the Licensed Software or (2) the combination, operation, or use of any Licensed Software furnished hereunder with any other software or data if such infringement would have been avoided by the combination, operation or use of the Licensed Software with other Software or data. The foregoing states the entire obligation of GTK with respect to infringement of patents or copyrights. 8. LIMITATION OF REMEDY GTK's AND PTI's ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DAMAGES DUE TO PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF ANY LICENSED SOFTWARE, ACTIONS BY GTK, PTI, OR ANY OTHER CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID TO GTK OR PTI.
