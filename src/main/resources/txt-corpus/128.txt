Procedure for obtaining licensed software on sponsored projects: Prepare a requisition form listing the description of items to be purchased. Complete the license agreement naming The Ohio State University Office of Sponsored Programs as licensee. Submit license agreement with completed requisition form to the Office of Sponsored Programs Procurement department. Policy for licenses related to purchases on sponsored projects: Licenses for software packages purchased routinely as off-the-shelf items will generally be signed by the user. The purchasing agent may sign such license agreements as the sole signatory if requested or in addition to the user when two signatures are required. When it is apparent that a requisition is for software that cannot be purchased routinely off-the-shelf, the purchasing agent will ask the principal investigator if the software will be modified or embedded in a product or a deliverable of the project. If this is the case, the request will be reviewed by a sponsored program officer who will determine whether the resultant license agreement requires a signature that binds the Office of Sponsored Programs or requires other special attention. All users of software with license agreements must be familiar with and adhere to the terms of the license agreement. Violators may be subject to disciplinary action and criminal prosecution. License agreements, where the Office of Sponsored Programs is the licensee, should be forwarded to the Office of Sponsored Programs for review and approval. 2013 The Ohio State University Office of Sponsored Programs Last Modified: November 24, 2009 If you have trouble accessing this page and need to request an alternate format, contact .
